# Recycler Go Brrrr
Print money using the 'Cash for Trash' Recyclers by simply opening the lid and pressing a button. Why pay $100 a day to hire a cleaner when you can earn $300 a day from the trash the game naturally spawns.

This mod is only for the Main branch of the game. Have not tested it on any of the Beta Branches.

# Summary
Are you tired of picking up individual garbage items and placing them in the trash? Do you really feel like its worth spending $100 a day on a cleaner for your property? This mod makes it easier to get money for collecting trash. When you lift the handle the recycler will check to see if there is any trash in the world. If there is you can press the button to get your payout.
